# About
This program creates a real-time 3D rotating cube visualization using only ASCII characters in the terminal. It renders a wireframe cube that continuously rotates around multiple axes, creating a mesmerizing spinning effect.

This project was inspired by a youtube video I watched that was able to animate a spinning cube in the terminal. I was able to achieve a similar result by following instructions in the video.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time 3D rendering in terminal using only ASCII characters</li>
- Smooth rotation animation with customizable speed</li>
- Perspective projection for realistic 3D depth</li>
- ASCII-based shading for enhanced visual depth</li>
- Zero dependencies - pure C implementation</li>
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows with appropriate terminal)</li>

## Visual
The cube appears to rotate smoothly in 3D space, with each face represented by a different ASCII character, creating a distinctive visual pattern that clearly shows the cube's geometry and rotation.
