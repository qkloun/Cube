## About
A mesmerizing 3D spinning cube rendered directly in your terminal using ASCII characters and C programming. Experience real-time 3D graphics without any external dependencies!

This project was inspired by a youtube video I watched that was able to animate a spinning cube in the terminal. I was able to achieve a similar result by following instructions in the video.
